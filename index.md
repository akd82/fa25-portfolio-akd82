## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ '/assets/images/profile-image.jpg' | relative_url }}){: .profile-image}

 
My name is Anish Dhawan, and I am a junior at Cornell University pursuing a Mechanical Engineering major and a Computer Science (minor). I'm driven by creativity and curiousity, always seeking opportunities to learn, to help, collaborate, and make a meaningful impact through my work.

I have a strong background in Python, data visualization, and project management, gained through my internships at Yale University's Bindra Lab and Aneja Lab, where I worked on image processing models and molecular biology data analysis. I enjoy combining the technical with problem-solving to develop a better understanding, or to enhance efficiency.

Outside of academics research, I am an Eagle Scout and dedicated community volunteer. I'm inspired by opportunities that allow me to help others, build meanningful connections, and continue growing both technically and personally.
