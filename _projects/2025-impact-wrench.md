For class, we were asked to dissect a mechanical object. The design was a pneumatic impact wrench. 

In addition to this, we made a 5 minute video explaining the fluid-dynamic operation of the tool—including compressible flow through the throttle valve, mass-flow-rate control, pressure-to-torque conversion inside the vane motor, and the resulting energy transfer that powers the hammer-and-anvil impact mechanism.
