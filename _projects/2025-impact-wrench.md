For class, we were asked to dissect a mechanical object. The design was a pneumatic impact wrench. 

In addition to this, we made a 4 minute video explaining the fluid-dynamic operation of the tool—including mass-flow-rate control, the ideal gas law, and pressure-to-torque conversion inside the vane motor.
