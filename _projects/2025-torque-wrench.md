For a class, we were asked to create a torque wrench that satisfies: safety factor of Xo = 4 for yield/brittle failure, safety factor of XK = 2 for crack growth from an assumed crack of depth 0.04 inches, fatigue stress safety factor of XS = 1.5, and material must be a steel, aluminum or titanium alloy.

2. AISI 4150 is a medium-carbon, chromium-molybdenum low-alloy steel. It’s a widely used alloy in structural, mechanical, and automotive components due to its balance of strength, toughness, hardenability, and wear resistance. 4150 in the normalized (this is often used as a pre-heat treatment before quenching, tempering, and a final condition process when moderate strength and toughness are desire) condition is heated above the austenitizing temperature and air-cooled, improving toughness, machinability, and a refined, uniform ferrite-pearlite microstructure.

From the FEM: Maximum Normal Stress at Gauge = 98.917 psi, Load Point Deflection = 0.43315 in, and Strain at the Strain Gauge Location = 1011 microstrain. These values are consistent with our calculations:

Torque Wrench Sensitivity = 1011 microstrain x 1000 = 1.011 mV/V
