For a class, we were asked to create a torque wrench that satisfies: safety factor of Xo = 4 for yield/brittle failure, safety of XK = 2 for crack growth from an assumed crack of depth 0.04 in, fatigue stress factor of XS = 1.5, and material must be a steel, aluminum or titanium alloy.

2. AISI 4150 is a medium-carbon, chromium-molybdenum low-alloy steel. It’s a widely used alloy in structural, mechanical, and automotive components due to its balance of strength, toughness, hardenability, and wear resistance. 4150 in the normalized condition is heated above the austenitizing temperature and air-cooled, improving toughness, machinability, and a refined ferrite-pearlite microstructure.

From the FEM: Maximum Normal Stress at Gauge = 98.917 psi, Load Point Deflection = 0.43315 in, and Strain at the Strain Gauge Location = 1011 microstrain. These values are consistent with our calculations:
